Natural Language Processing aims to understand and model properties of human language 
and the ways it is learned, produced and interpreted.
Participants in the seminar will choose from a wide range of topics including but not 
limited to sentiment and opinion analysis, racial, ethnic, gender, religious bias
detection and mitigation, identification of fake news, computational humor, 
question answering, and automated reasoning, financial market prediction, in English or another natural
language (exploration of data in a less studied language
is encouraged and knowledge of a language is not a necessary prerequisite).
Some past students have pursued projects in computational analyses of music data, 
classifying specific composers, styles, lyrics, or
generating music. Other projects focused on data relating to students' 
extracurricular interests, such as running, rock climbing, food, and
language puzzles.

<br>&nbsp;<br>

Each student will identify, scrape, clean and pre-process a dataset, using freely 
available resources. Data may come from
available text corpora, news outlets, blogs, tweets, etc. Students will apply (and 
possibly improve on) existing pre-processing tools
for tokenization, lemmatizing, part-of-speech tagging, and syntactic parsing (the 
NLP "pipeline"). The focus will be on the analysis
of explicit or implicit meaning in texts, on the word, sentence or document level.
Students may wish to analyze linguistic data dealing with recent political or social
 questions (e.g., media coverage of the elections in
the US or elsewhere, the pandemic; gender/racial/nationality/religious bias). 
Different approaches to semantic analysis, using lexical resources, embeddings, LLMs, 
etc. will be considered and applied. Projects often (but not necessarily) 
include a machine learning component.

 <br>&nbsp;<br>

There is no course requirement beyond the 200-level COS classes. Students need 
not have prior independent research experience.
Students may work in pairs so long as each student covers a separate aspect of the 
same project.

We will meet each week during the semester as a group and discuss everyone's project
, progress, challenges and findings.
More details about the seminar format will be provided in our first meeting 
(September 6).
